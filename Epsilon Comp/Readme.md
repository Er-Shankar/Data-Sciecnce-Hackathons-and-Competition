**Target Industry** - Banking and Financial Services

Banks have diverse sources of revenue. These sources can be classified into non-interest sources and interest sources. 

Non-interest income is bank and creditor income derived primarily from fees including deposit and transaction fees, insufficient
funds (NSF) fees, annaul fees, monthly account service charges, inactivity fees, check and deposit slip fees and so on.

Traditionally, the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customers. The bank profits from the
difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its
lending activities. Historically, profitability from leanding activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strenghts of 
loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle.

Of late, one of the major concerns that banks are facing is the increasing amount of non-performing assets or NPAs, often called 
** Bad Debts*. When borrowers default on their interest payments to the bank and eventually progress to a situation wherein they can
no longer repay the bank, we term the net loss incurred from the borrowing activity as NPAs. With this as the key objective, banks
 wish to strenghtn their decision making algorithm to have a better understanding as to the risk they are exposed to with each loan given.

 Recently, many new customers have approached the bank for the prupose of acquiring loans. The bank is interested in finding out whether

 Pertaining to this objective, sample train dataset has been assembled which related to the previous loan takers of the bank and whether
 these customers were able to repay the amount of loan taken by them based upon certain factors.
 
 The task at hand for you is to estimate the likelihood of the bank loan default on account of a borrower based on multplie factors like
 Loan term, Credit Score, Gender, Type of Loan etc.
